Diabetes is a chronic condition where your body can’t properly regulate blood sugar (glucose). In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas fails to produce insulin—so daily insulin injections are non-negotiable. In type 2 diabetes, your cells resist insulin’s signal; lifestyle factors like obesity and inactivity drive most cases, though genetics play a role. Gestational diabetes affects some pregnant people and raises future risks for both parent and child

Unchecked high blood sugar damages vessels and nerves. Early signs include excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue and blurry vision. Over time, it can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, nerve damage and limb amputations. Foot ulcers are common—and deadly when infected. Cardiovascular risk doubles for people with diabetes compared to their peers

Managing diabetes means solutions, not theory:

Test and monitor: Check blood glucose regularly; aim for targets set with your care team.
Healthy eating: Use carb-counting or the plate method. Focus on whole grains, lean protein, vegetables and limit added sugars

Move daily: At least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly—walking, cycling or swimming.
Medication: Metformin is first-line for type 2; many will need additional agents (SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists) or insulin. Type 1 always needs insulin

Prevent complications: Control blood pressure and lipids with medication if needed; schedule annual eye, kidney and foot exams. Enroll in diabetes self-management education to build skills and confidence.
